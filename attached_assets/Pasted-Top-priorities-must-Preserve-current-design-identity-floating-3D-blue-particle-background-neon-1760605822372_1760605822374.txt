Top priorities (must):

Preserve current design identity (floating 3D blue particle background, neon-blue accent) and make it work for both dark and light themes.

Put all Free Fire tools & utilities in one place (Tools hub). Tools UI must let the user:

Select a tool from a visually appealing, responsive selector (grid or horizontally scrollable cards on mobile).

After selecting, navigate to a dedicated tool page (clean layout, instructions, large primary CTA).

Show clear step-by-step UI with progress, validation, and toasts for success/error.

Fix misaligned tool-selection buttons so they look PERFECT across phones, tablets and desktop (use responsive Flex/Grid + consistent spacing, center content and scale touch targets).

Add as many tasteful, performant animations as possible (use CSS transforms, intersection-observer triggered animations; avoid heavy JS animation libs unless necessary).

Add more Free Fire tools: expand from 4 → at least 8 useful tools (examples below). Tools should be real utilities or UX helpers, not spammy:

Sensitivity Advisor (detailed) — see section below

Sensitivity Presets (pubg/free fire & controller presets)

Free Fire Loadout Planner

Auto Thumbnail Creator (images, templates)

Image Compressor (with exact target-size options)

Text-to-Speech (TTS) with multiple voices + download

Video-to-GIF or Clip Trimmer (small utility)

KBS / KB size optimizer (quality vs. size)

QR / Invite link generator for Telegram / socials

One ad slot per page (non-intrusive placement): e.g., below hero section or between content blocks on desktop; inside page content below header on mobile. For every page, include placeholder <div id="ad-slot" data-ad="single"> and instructions to insert AdSense code there once approved.

Detailed UX & features — Tools Hub & Sensitivity tool:

Tools Hub:

Use an attractive card grid on desktop (3–4 columns), 2 columns on tablet, horizontal swipeable carousel on mobile.

Each card: icon, short description (1 line), CTA “Use Tool”, small tags (e.g., #sensitivity #freefire #dpi).

Add quick filters at top: All | Free Fire | Image | Audio | Utility.

Add search bar with live filter.

Navigation breadcrumbs: Tools → [Tool Name].

Provide direct nav links to Home, Projects, Tools, Utilities, Contact on all pages (sticky header with compact mobile menu).

When user clicks “Use Tool”:

Navigate to a dedicated route /tools/<tool-slug> with clear H1, short instructions, main input/form on left, preview/result on right (or stacked on mobile).

Show animated progress bar while processing.

Show device selector for tools that depend on device (sensitivity, DPI): dropdown with icons — Mobile (Touch), Controller, Mouse + Keyboard, and specific device models (optional).

Sensitivity Advisor (most important tool):

Steps:

User selects Device: Mobile (Touch), Controller, Mouse+Keyboard.

If Mobile: ask screen size & DPI (or provide common DPI options), preferred sensitivity style (low/med/high/aggressive), and gameplay role (sniper, rush, support).

If Mouse+Keyboard: ask DPI, mouse inches per 360 (optional), ADS sensitivity preference.

Provide recommended sensitivity values for all in-game sliders and provide presets users can copy or download (e.g., JSON or simple copy button).

Provide extra device settings suggestions: DPI, polling rate, recommended ADS multipliers, FOV if applicable.

Offer “Apply Preset” style export: Copy text, JSON download, or a one-click copy-to-clipboard.

Provide small animated helper visuals that show how sensitivity will feel (tiny demo gif or animated reticle).

Display a “Why this works” short explanation line (savage + friendly tone).

Image Compressor:

Allow upload, then select target size: Auto, 1 MB, 2 MB, 500 KB, or custom KB.

Optionally allow JPEG/WEBP/PNG output selection and quality slider.

Show preview and download button; show original vs compressed size comparison and quality preview.

Label “YouTube thumbnail optimized” presets.

Text-to-Speech (TTS):

Provide multiple voice options: at least 4 distinct voices (male/female/robotic/energetic).

Language and accent selection (EN-IN, EN-US, etc. if possible).

“Download” button to save MP3/OGG.

Show waveform animation while playing.

KBS / KB Optimizer:

Show conversion/compression options and show final estimated bytes.

Add presets for thumbnails, streaming thumbnails, and thumbnails for WhatsApp limit.

General utility features:

Activity log: show last successful uses (no PII).

Real-time counters: “Tools used today”, “Total users” — shown publicly for trust.

VIP toggle (optional): if a user has VIP token, unlock unlimited usage.

Design & Animation specifics:

Preserve floating 3D particles — make them GPU-friendly (Canvas or lightweight THREE/particles) and allow toggle off for low-end devices.

Keep the background particle fold blue and glowy — ensure contrast remains for light theme too by changing particle colors/opacity for light theme.

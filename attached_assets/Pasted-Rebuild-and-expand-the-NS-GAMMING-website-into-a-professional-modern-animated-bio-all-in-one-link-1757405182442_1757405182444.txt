Rebuild and expand the NS GAMMING website into a professional, modern, animated, bio/all-in-one link website.
Primary identity shown everywhere:

Gaming name: NS GAMMING

Nickname / common name: Nishant

Official name: Naboraj Sarkar

Show name on site as: NS GAMING (or Nishant Sarkar). Most visitors know me as Nishant — use that tone.

DOB: 19 August (do not show year)

Location: Siliguri, West Bengal, India

Nationality: Indian

Religion: Hindu Bengali

Main motive / mission (must replace “buy a PC”):

> My mission is to build my OWN EMPIRE, change the future, keep learning, and build things I love. Nishant loves coding, building, learning, and growing a community. This is the emotional heart of the site.



Old site (mention only): https://nsgamming.xzy — do not merge domains.


Hard non-negotiables

No backend, no hidden pages, no secrets in server code. Everything is static HTML/CSS/JS with all content and links visible in code.

Contact page must only include: business email nishant.ns.business@gmail.com, WhatsApp chat https://wa.me/918900653250, and Telegram chat https://t.me/Nishantsarkar10k. No personal email.

Social links go on the Social page only (not on Contact).

One AdSense ad per page only — centered and responsive; no two ads on the same page.

All text (bios, intros, captions, motivational lines) must be written in a warm, emotional voice AS IF WRITTEN BY NISHANT. Add small Hinglish lines occasionally (“Chalo shuru karte hain!”, “Thank you yaar 🙏”, etc.) — tasteful & short.

✨ Visual + UX Requirements (Global)

Theme: Neon / blue gaming glow; modern glassmorphism and sleek typography.

Landing-style hero at the top of every page (not just Home) — a strong, animated hero that reads like a landing page: logo + small profile card + CTAs.

Front page should be big, bold, slightly loud but NOT messy. Clean layout, clear sections, good spacing — each section with its own micro-animations and slow, tasteful neon glows.

Particles / interactive background that reacts to cursor movement; subtle parallax layers (stars, neon lines).

Heavy but tasteful animation: logo intro, typewriter/glitch accents, fading slide-up sections, neon button pulses, animated SVG icons, micro interactions (hover, focus, pressed).

Every page must have a smooth landing/entrance effect (animate in when the page loads) and scroll reveal animations for sections.

Accessible & responsive: readable fonts, proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and mobile-first design.

Surprises & delights: include small, unexpected micro-interactions (examples below).

All copy must be emotive, human, and written by Nishant — not robotic.



---

🏠 Home (Front) Page — the new priority

Goal: Big first impression — present identity + mission clearly, invite navigation, but don’t cram everything. Keep games off hero; link to Games page.
Hero / Above the Fold (landing effect, animated):

Large animated logo: NS GAMING (glow + subtle glitch + typewriter subtagline).

Tagline (emotional voice):

> “Hi, I’m Nishant (Naboraj Sarkar) — Creator • Developer • Gamer. I build, learn, and create to build my empire and change the future. Join the journey.”



Profile card on the right or below hero (avatar circle or dynamic particle silhouette), with: name variants NS GAMING / Nishant Sarkar, short emotional summary written by Nishant (3–4 lines). Add a tiny Hinglish line like: “Aao saath banayein kuch naya — let’s build!”

3 primary CTAs (neat, glassy neon buttons): About • Portfolio • Games (each with micro-interaction). Do not show all games here — just “Games” link.

One Ad: place AFTER the hero but above long content (only one ad on the front page). Centered, responsive, and visually separated.

Mini highlights row (3–4 icons + short animated blurbs): Coding / Content / Community / Football — each blurb 1 sentence, lovingly written by Nishant.

Featured short reel: a small embedded YouTube preview card linking to latest video (thumbnail with neon play button). Text: “🎥 New videos every week — join the ride!”

Surprise module: small secret Easter egg — e.g., press N on keyboard to show a quick confetti burst and a short loving message from Nishant (“Thank you for stopping by — you rock!”). Document this in code with a comment.

Footer CTA strip: subtle banner: “Want a site like this? Chat with me →” (links to Commission/Chat page and WhatsApp).


Copywriting: All copy here must be longer and filled with emotion. Example:

> “I’m building more than streams and code — I’m building a family. From late-night coding sessions to gameplay highlights, har line mera dil se likha gaya hai. Let’s grow together.”

👤 About Page

Landing hero (small) + long, heartfelt biography written by Nishant: childhood context (Siliguri), inspirations, learning, mission to build an empire and make an impact, how coding & gaming shaped values. Use Hinglish touches and loving tone.

Timeline or milestones (animated): learning HTML → first project → YouTube start → community moments. Each milestone has a short emotional caption.

Stats & values cards (Passion, Learning, Community).

One Ad block after main bio content.

CTA: link to Portfolio / Games / Contact.



---

💼 Portfolio Page

Landing hero + gallery of projects and content cards (GitHub, YouTube, sample projects).

For each project card: Title, 2–3 line description (written by Nishant), tech used, short animated preview or GIF (if possible).

Links: GitHub https://github.com/ns-gamming and YouTube https://youtube.com/@Nishant_sarkar with glowing CTAs.

One Ad block at bottom of main portfolio content.

Motivational microcopy sprinkled: “Code is my medium, community is my mission.”

🎮 Games (Dedicated Page)

Landing hero: “Play & Chill — Games by NS GAMING” — clean, not crowded.

DO NOT put the five games on the front page. Only link to this Games page.

Game listing: cards for 5 games (Tic Tac Toe, Snake, Memory Match, Flappy Clone, Rock-Paper-Scissors). Each card: title, 1-sentence emotional intro, “Play” CTA that opens the game page. Micro animation on hover.

Each game gets its own page (full-screen or centered canvas), polished UI, instructions, motivational caption, keyboard/touch controls, and one Ad on that game page only.

Game pages are interactive, themed with neon skins and animated feedback. Small victory animation (particles/confetti) on winning, with loving messages: e.g., “Woh! You won — proud of your grind ❤️” or Hinglish hugs.

Games are lightweight JS (no external servers), clean code, mobile-friendly.

Analytics / tracking: none (no hidden backends). If analytics is desired later, mention separately.



---

🌍 Social Page

Landing hero + grid of neon social CTAs (YouTube, Instagram, Telegram Channel, VIP Telegram Group, Discord, Reddit, LinkedIn, X).

Each card: icon, short emotional message from Nishant about why follow there, CTA.

🔎 Microcopy & Emotive Text Rules

Every piece of visible copy must be written as if Nishant wrote it — warm, humble, excited. Use short Hinglish touches occasionally: e.g., “Shukriya yaar — you mean a lot”, “Chalo next level!”

Include short motivational notes across pages: “Keep going, keep building,” “You’re not alone — join the family,” “Coding se duniya badlegi.”

Add micro testimonials or community blurbs (fake placeholder lines written lovingly) to make the site feel warm.



---

🎁 Surprise / Delight Ideas (choose 2–4)

Easter key: pressing N shows a small confetti burst + personal message from Nishant.

Secret mini-game hidden in the footer (small, simple, like a 5-second reaction tester) — optional but delightful.

Time-aware greeting in top-left: “Good morning / Good afternoon / Good night, gamer!” with a small Hinglish line.

Interactive avatar: hover to make particles swirl; click for a short charming message.

Achievement badges appear when user visits pages (small UI flair).
(Implement 2 by default: confetti N easter + time-aware greeting.)

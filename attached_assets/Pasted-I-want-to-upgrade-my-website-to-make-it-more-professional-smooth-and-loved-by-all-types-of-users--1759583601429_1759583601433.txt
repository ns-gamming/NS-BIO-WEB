I want to upgrade my website to make it more professional, smooth, and loved by all types of users.
Keep the current dark theme as it is, but also add a light (white) theme option so visitors can switch between them easily.

Make both themes look modern, clean, and premium, with smooth transitions, hover effects, and gentle animations that make the site feel lively and interactive.

Add 1 ad per page (only one) ‚Äî place it neatly, like below the main content or in a sidebar, so it doesn‚Äôt ruin the layout or user experience.

Also, integrate a Gemini AI chatbot that chats like a real human, remembers basic context (short memory), and can answer questions about me (Nishant / Naboraj Sarkar) and the website (NS GAMMING).

üß† Chatbot details:

Use the Gemini API key directly (no backend):

The chatbot should be fully frontend only (no backend/server code).

It must work on every page of the site ‚Äî like a floating chat bubble or side panel.

The chat box should have a semi-transparent background so it blends well with both dark and light themes.

Make sure the design matches the site ‚Äî futuristic, smooth, and glowing style that fits the NS GAMMING brand.

Add smooth animations when opening/closing or sending messages.

üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Information the chatbot should know:

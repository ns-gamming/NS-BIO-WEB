Fix and fully optimize my website nsgamming.xyz (deployed via Vercel and hosted from GitHub).

Problems to fix:

1. Blog pages are not showing after deployment (even after searching). Fix the blog system so all blog posts appear properly and can be opened, using static markdown files or static generation — no backend required.


2. The AI/chat assistant (star icon) doesn’t respond and overlaps with other buttons like the scroll-up arrow and chatbot. It should only appear on blog pages, not on other pages.


3. The UI should look more professional, modern, and detailed — with smooth animations, shadows, hover effects, transitions, and perfect responsiveness across all screen sizes and both dark & light themes.


4. Ensure no backend or paid service is required — everything must work with static generation (SSG) or client-side code.


5. The website must be fully SEO-optimized for Google AdSense and ranking, including:

Proper meta tags (title, description, canonical, Open Graph, Twitter)

Article structured data (schema.org/Article JSON-LD)

Sitemap and robots.txt

Internal linking and keyword-rich tags

High performance and mobile-first design



6. Make the blog and other pages rank #1 in Google for searches related to my name and brand:

“NS GAMMING”, “Nishant Sarkar”, “Naboraj Sarkar”, “Naboraj”, “NS Team”, “NS Group”, “NS”, “Nishant”, etc.



7. Add as many relevant SEO tags and metadata as possible according to each page and product.



Requirements:

Keep all features free (no paid backend).

Use Next.js (or static React) with Tailwind CSS.

Use getStaticProps / getStaticPaths or a markdown-based static blog system.

Make the chatbot, blog AI, and scroll buttons have correct spacing and z-index.

Include subtle, high-quality animations (Framer Motion or CSS).

Make it AdSense-friendly and accessible.

Generate meta data, sitemap, and robots.txt automatically for SEO.


Goal:
Build the best-looking, fully functional, SEO-optimized version of nsgamming.xyz that:

Loads perfectly on every device

Shows all blogs correctly

Has a responsive and working blog-assistant AI

Has modern animations and clear structure

Is Google AdSense–ready and ranks easily


💡 Output expected:

Corrected & optimized source code

Folder/file structure clearly shown (pages/blog, components/BlogAssistant, etc.)

Proper meta tags and SEOHead component

Markdown example post (posts/example.md)

Instructions for deploying to Vercel

(Optional) Added Framer Motion or Lottie animations for better visuals.

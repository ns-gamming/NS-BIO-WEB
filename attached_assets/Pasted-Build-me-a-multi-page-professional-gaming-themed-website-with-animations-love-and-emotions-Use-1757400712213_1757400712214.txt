Build me a multi-page professional gaming-themed website with animations, love, and emotions ❤️. Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no backend). Do not hide any secrets — directly put everything in the code.

🔹 Website Style

Theme color: Blue 💙

Background: 3D gaming-style background with moving particles/animated effects

All sections, buttons, and text must have smooth animations (hover, fade, glow, bounce).

Responsive for mobile + desktop.

🔹 Landing Page (Home)

Opening Animation: At page load, show glowing animated logo + text “NSGaming”.

Create a temporary glowing logo placeholder in the code (I’ll edit later).

Hero Section:

Text: Hi, I’m Nishant Sarkar 🎮

Subtitle: Creator | Developer | Gamer

🔹 Footer

Text:

© 2025 Nishant Sarkar | NSGaming 💙  
Made with love, passion, and gaming vibes 🎮✨  

🔹 Notes for AI

Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Do not add backend, APIs, or hidden secrets.

Ads should not break the layout (center them with margin).

Add dark/light mode toggle 🌙☀️.

Make it clean, professional, and filled with animations.

Write every text with love, emotions, and emojis ❤️.

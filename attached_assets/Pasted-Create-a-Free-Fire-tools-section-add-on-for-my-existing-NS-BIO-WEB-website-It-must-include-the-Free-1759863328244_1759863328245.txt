Create a Free Fire tools section add-on for my existing NS-BIO-WEB website. It must include the Free Fire Likes tool, allow dynamic region selection, integrate Supabase for 1-use-per-IP/day, preserve existing animations and transitions, and be fully responsive on all devices. Include one ad per page and an Upcoming Tools section for future bots.

1. Free Fire Likes Tool Requirements

Inputs:

UID (8‚Äì11 digits)

Region (user can type or select from available options: sg, ind, cis, pk, th, br, bd, me, vn, etc.)

Submit Action:

Call the Free Fire Likes API:

https://likes.api.freefireofficial.com/api/{region}/{uid}?key=testkey12

2. Supabase Integration (1-use-per-IP/day)

Supabase Project URL:

https://zsithfxmjtyeummbchpy.supabase.co


Supabase anon key:

eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InpzaXRoZnhtanR5ZXVtbWJjaHB5Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4NTUwOTEsImV4cCI6MjA3NTQzMTA5MX0.h8ej73edKcLyQJxY-N1irLc4tXTnavDVOySLF1aC5ps


Table usage_logs structure:

Column Name	Type	Notes
id	uuid	Primary key, auto-generated
ip	text	User IP or browser fingerprint
uid	text	Free Fire UID submitted (optional)
region	text	Server selected by the user
used_at	timestamptz	Timestamp when the user used the tool

RLS Policies:

Insert Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for anon users"
ON public.usage_logs
AS PERMISSIVE
FOR INSERT
TO public
WITH CHECK (true);


Select Policy:

CREATE POLICY "Allow select for anon users"
ON public.usage_logs
AS PERMISSIVE
FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (true);


Logic:

Before calling the API, query usage_logs for today with the user‚Äôs IP.

If exists ‚Üí show message ‚ÄúYou have already used this tool today.‚Äù

If not ‚Üí call API ‚Üí if likes given ‚Üí insert new row into usage_logs.

3. API Response Handling

Success (status = 1) example:

{
  "response": {
    "KeyExpiresAt":"2025-10-17T17:12:40.967974",
    "KeyRemainingRequests":"14/15",
    "LikesGivenByAPI":100,
    "LikesafterCommand":1504,
    "LikesbeforeCommand":1404,
    "PlayerLevel":52,
    "PlayerNickname":"Nardo_2",
    "UID":"9725003145"
  },
  "status":1
}


Display to user:

üéâ Congratulations! Likes sent successfully!
Player: Nardo_2
UID: 9725003145
Level: 52
Likes Before: 1404
Likes Added: 100
Likes After: 1504


Do not show: KeyRemainingRequests or KeyExpiresAt

UID already used elsewhere (status = 3) ‚Üí show API message, do not record in Supabase.

Invalid UID (status = 3) ‚Üí show API message, do not record in Supabase.

0 Likes given (status = 2) ‚Üí show API message, do not record in Supabase.

4. Frontend / UX Requirements

5. Upcoming Tools Section

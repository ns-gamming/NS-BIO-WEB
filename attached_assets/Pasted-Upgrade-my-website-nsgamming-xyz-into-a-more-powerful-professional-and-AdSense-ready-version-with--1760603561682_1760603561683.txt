Upgrade my website nsgamming.xyz into a more powerful, professional, and AdSense-ready version with a full blog system and a smart AI chatbot (powered by Gemini API).
Keep the same 3D floating blue particle background, modern UI, and ensure it looks beautiful on both dark and light themes, responsive for all devices, and free from all errors.

📰 BLOG SECTION (5+ Informative Articles)

Create a blog page that includes at least 5 unique, detailed, and high-quality articles, fully SEO optimized and filled with real, helpful information — not generic or repetitive AI content.
Each article should be written with passion and creativity ❤️

Topics for the first 5+ articles:

How to grow fast as a YouTuber 🎥

Beginner’s guide to crypto and investing 💰

Basics of cyber security and online privacy 🧠

Tips for content creation and online growth 💡

How gaming can help build real-life skills 🎮
(You can also add 1–2 bonus articles with unique trending topics if needed.)

Each blog page should include:
✅ One Ad per page (AdSense-friendly and well-placed).
✅ Smooth animations (scroll reveal, fade, transitions).
✅ Share buttons (WhatsApp, Telegram, Twitter, Instagram).
✅ A view counter that shows realistic increasing views.
✅ Readable fonts and clean spacing for a premium experience.
✅ Option for users to “Read Article” aloud in a human-like voice.
✅ Option for users to ask AI questions related to that article (chatbot integration).
✅ Updated privacy policy linked clearly from every page footer — rewritten for AdSense approval and modern policy standards (data, cookies, ads, etc.).

🤖 AI CHATBOT (Powered by Free Gemini API Key)

Now integrate a smart AI chatbot assistant that can help users across the entire site — including the blog and Free Fire tools.
Use this Gemini API key securely:

The chatbot should:

💬 Answer user questions about Free Fire tools, sensitivity settings, utilities, crypto, YouTube, cyber security, and all blog articles.

🔍 Guide users smoothly between different pages of the site.

🧠 Read and understand website data automatically (articles, descriptions, etc.) to give context-aware replies.

🎙️ Include a voice chat option — users can talk and listen to the bot in a natural voice.

✨ Animated chat UI with typing effects, floating bubbles, and smooth transitions.

🌗 Work perfectly in both dark and light themes.

🧭 Always appear on every page (floating icon in the corner).

📊 Support session memory so it remembers what the user asked about within a session.

💡 Provide “quick suggestion” buttons (like “Show tools,” “Read articles,” etc.)

UI should match the site theme with:

Rounded corners, glassmorphism style

Matching blue gradients

Clean, friendly, gaming-tech vibe

3D floating background particles

Backend setup:

Use Gemini (1.5 Flash) for real, fast, helpful answers.

Secure the API key (do not expose publicly).

Allow me (the admin) to easily update prompts or chatbot data later from backend settings.

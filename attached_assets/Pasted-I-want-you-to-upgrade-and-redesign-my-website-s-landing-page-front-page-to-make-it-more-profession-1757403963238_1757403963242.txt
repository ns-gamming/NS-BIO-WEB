I want you to upgrade and redesign my website’s landing page (front page) to make it more professional, modern, detailed, and animated, since it’s the first impression.

🔹 Identity & Name

My gaming name: NS GAMMING

My nickname: Nishant

My official name: Naboraj Sarkar

Most people know me as Nishant, so on the website it should mainly show “NS GAMMING” or “Nishant Sarkar”.


🔹 Landing Page Goals

1. The landing page should instantly introduce me as a gamer, creator, and developer.


2. Use glowing animations, neon effects, and smooth transitions to make it eye-catching.


3. Should feel like a gaming profile meets a professional portfolio.


4. All other pages (About, Portfolio, Social, Contact, Goals) should also have the same modern landing-style section at the top (so every page looks like a landing page, not just plain content).



🔹 What to Add on the Home Page

Big Logo Animation:

Show glowing “NS GAMMING” with a typewriter effect or glitch animation.

Under it, show my tagline:

> “Hi, I’m Nishant (Naboraj Sarkar) 🎮 — Creator | Developer | Gamer”




Hero Section with Profile Card:

Add a profile card / avatar circle with my name: NS GAMMING (Nishant Sarkar).

A short intro paragraph (student from Siliguri, India, passionate about coding, Free Fire, football, YouTube).

Buttons: [About Me] [Portfolio] [Connect].


Skills/Passions Highlight (with icons + glow animation):

Coding 💻

Gaming 🎮

Football ⚽

Content Creation 🎥


Animated Background Elements:

Particles / glowing stars + maybe neon lines moving.

Hover effects when cursor moves.


Scroll-Down Animation:

A glowing arrow suggesting the user scrolls down.


Mini Showcase / Featured Links:

Small section linking to GitHub & YouTube with glowing icons.



🔹 UI & Animation Notes

Keep the blue neon glow theme.

Add glassmorphism sections with blur and glow.

Buttons should pulse or glow slightly on hover.

Text and sections should fade/slide in smoothly as user scrolls.

The design should be responsive for both mobile and desktop.


🔹 Footer

Keep the same footer, but add a scroll-to-top glowing button.

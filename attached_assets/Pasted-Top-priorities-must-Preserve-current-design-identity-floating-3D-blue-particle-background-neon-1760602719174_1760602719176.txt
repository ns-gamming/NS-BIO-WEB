Top priorities (must):

Preserve current design identity (floating 3D blue particle background, neon-blue accent) and make it work for both dark and light themes.

Put all Free Fire tools & utilities in one place (Tools hub). Tools UI must let the user:

Select a tool from a visually appealing, responsive selector (grid or horizontally scrollable cards on mobile).

After selecting, navigate to a dedicated tool page (clean layout, instructions, large primary CTA).

Show clear step-by-step UI with progress, validation, and toasts for success/error.

Fix misaligned tool-selection buttons so they look PERFECT across phones, tablets and desktop (use responsive Flex/Grid + consistent spacing, center content and scale touch targets).

Add as many tasteful, performant animations as possible (use CSS transforms, intersection-observer triggered animations; avoid heavy JS animation libs unless necessary).

Add more Free Fire tools: expand from 4 → at least 8 useful tools (examples below). Tools should be real utilities or UX helpers, not spammy:

Sensitivity Advisor (detailed) — see section below

Sensitivity Presets (pubg/free fire & controller presets)

Free Fire Loadout Planner

Auto Thumbnail Creator (images, templates)

Image Compressor (with exact target-size options)

Text-to-Speech (TTS) with multiple voices + download

Video-to-GIF or Clip Trimmer (small utility)

KBS / KB size optimizer (quality vs. size)

QR / Invite link generator for Telegram / socials

One ad slot per page (non-intrusive placement): e.g., below hero section or between content blocks on desktop; inside page content below header on mobile. For every page, include placeholder <div id="ad-slot" data-ad="single"> and instructions to insert AdSense code there once approved.

Detailed UX & features — Tools Hub & Sensitivity tool:

Tools Hub:

Use an attractive card grid on desktop (3–4 columns), 2 columns on tablet, horizontal swipeable carousel on mobile.

Each card: icon, short description (1 line), CTA “Use Tool”, small tags (e.g., #sensitivity #freefire #dpi).

Add quick filters at top: All | Free Fire | Image | Audio | Utility.

Add search bar with live filter.

Navigation breadcrumbs: Tools → [Tool Name].

Provide direct nav links to Home, Projects, Tools, Utilities, Contact on all pages (sticky header with compact mobile menu).

When user clicks “Use Tool”:

Navigate to a dedicated route /tools/<tool-slug> with clear H1, short instructions, main input/form on left, preview/result on right (or stacked on mobile).

Show animated progress bar while processing.

Show device selector for tools that depend on device (sensitivity, DPI): dropdown with icons — Mobile (Touch), Controller, Mouse + Keyboard, and specific device models (optional).

Sensitivity Advisor (most important tool):

Steps:

User selects Device: Mobile (Touch), Controller, Mouse+Keyboard.

If Mobile: ask screen size & DPI (or provide common DPI options), preferred sensitivity style (low/med/high/aggressive), and gameplay role (sniper, rush, support).

If Mouse+Keyboard: ask DPI, mouse inches per 360 (optional), ADS sensitivity preference.

Provide recommended sensitivity values for all in-game sliders and provide presets users can copy or download (e.g., JSON or simple copy button).

Provide extra device settings suggestions: DPI, polling rate, recommended ADS multipliers, FOV if applicable.

Offer “Apply Preset” style export: Copy text, JSON download, or a one-click copy-to-clipboard.

Provide small animated helper visuals that show how sensitivity will feel (tiny demo gif or animated reticle).

Display a “Why this works” short explanation line (savage + friendly tone).

Image Compressor:

Allow upload, then select target size: Auto, 1 MB, 2 MB, 500 KB, or custom KB.

Optionally allow JPEG/WEBP/PNG output selection and quality slider.

Show preview and download button; show original vs compressed size comparison and quality preview.

Label “YouTube thumbnail optimized” presets.

Text-to-Speech (TTS):

Provide multiple voice options: at least 4 distinct voices (male/female/robotic/energetic).

Language and accent selection (EN-IN, EN-US, etc. if possible).

“Download” button to save MP3/OGG.

Show waveform animation while playing.

KBS / KB Optimizer:

Show conversion/compression options and show final estimated bytes.

Add presets for thumbnails, streaming thumbnails, and thumbnails for WhatsApp limit.

General utility features:

Activity log: show last successful uses (no PII).

Real-time counters: “Tools used today”, “Total users” — shown publicly for trust.

VIP toggle (optional): if a user has VIP token, unlock unlimited usage.

Design & Animation specifics:

Preserve floating 3D particles — make them GPU-friendly (Canvas or lightweight THREE/particles) and allow toggle off for low-end devices.

Keep the background particle fold blue and glowy — ensure contrast remains for light theme too by changing particle colors/opacity for light theme.

Dark & Light themes: maintain consistent colors; dark uses neon-blue glow; light uses soft-blue glass effect.

Use CSS variables for theme colors and prefer hardware-accelerated transforms for animations.

Accessibility: all images must have alt text; keyboard navigation and focus styles; labels and ARIA where needed.

SEO, Meta, AdSense & discoverability:

Add rich meta tags:

title, meta description (page-specific), OG tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url), Twitter cards.

Create sitemap.xml and robots.txt.

Add page-structured data JSON-LD for site and tools (schema.org: WebSite + SoftwareApplication for tools).

Add many relevant tags and keywords on Tools pages and meta keywords targeted around: Free Fire sensitivity, Free Fire tools, image compressor for YouTube, text to speech, Free Fire settings, gaming utilities, NS GAMMiNG.

Put exactly one ad slot per page — add placeholder container and ensure the layout won't jump when ad loads (reserve space). Insert ad code only on server or via safe injection when AdSense is approved.

Security & backend:

Keep secrets out of repo: use .env and server-side env variables on Replit.

Implement server-side rate limiting: 1 free use per user/IP per tool per day — use Supabase/Firebase DB or Redis to track usage and enforce.

Add CAPTCHA or lightweight token to reduce bot abuse on heavy tools.

Validate and sanitize user inputs (file uploads, text).

Ensure file uploads are scanned and stored temporarily (delete after 24 hours).

Provide detailed logging for admin (no PII).

Performance & build:

Lazy-load heavy libs (TTS engines, large image libs).

Compress images, use WebP where possible.

Use code-splitting for tool pages.

Provide a fallback low-motion mode if user prefers reduced motion.

Copywriting / Tone:

All UI text should be short, confident, playful, savage-with-love. Example:

Hero CTA: “NS GAMMiNG — Tools that actually win. ⚡ Use smart. Play savage.”

Tool CTA: “Get Best Sensitivity” / “Compress & Download”

Small helper: “No fluff. Just wins.”

Provide microcopy for each tool explaining usage and safety/disclaimer for Free Fire tools (don’t promise cheating; provide guidance and legal disclaimers).

Deliverables & acceptance criteria (what I want back):

Full branch feature/tools-upgrade with all code changes, properly committed.

Working demo deployed on Replit (share link), or clear Replit deploy instructions + replit.nix / start command changed if necessary.

PR description listing files changed and the steps to test each tool.

Unit tests or at least smoke tests for critical APIs (upload, compress, TTS, sensitivity logic).

A small README.md update with admin steps, env variables list, and how to insert AdSense code.

A list of new keywords/meta tags added.

Testing checklist (run before final):

Mobile, tablet, desktop visuals for Tools selection are aligned, not clipped.

Sensitivity tool gives sensible presets for Mobile, Controller and Mouse+Keyboard.

Image compressor can target 1MB and 2MB, produces downloadable file, and quality preview is ok.

TTS supports at least 4 voices and download works.

One ad placeholder present and layout reserved.

One free use per IP enforced.

Particles run but can be toggled off.

Theme toggles correctly (dark/light).

No console errors during normal flows.

Hey Replit Agent 👋

I’ve built a full-frontend website for my Free Fire Likes Tool using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It works perfectly inside Replit — the Supabase connection is correct, and my API requests work fine.
However, when I push the code to GitHub and then deploy it on my custom domain using Vercel, the “Get Likes” feature stops working.

Here’s what happens:

The site loads normally.

But when I try to fetch likes from the API, it throws a “fetching error” in the console.

The same code and API key work fine in Replit, so it’s not a coding issue — it’s a hosting or environment issue.

⚙️ Technical Details

Supabase Project URL: https://zsithfxmjtyeummbchpy.supabase.co

Anon Public API Key: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InpzaXRoZnhtanR5ZXVtbWJjaHB5Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4NTUwOTEsImV4cCI6MjA3NTQzMTA5MX0.h8ej73edKcLyQJxY-N1irLc4tXTnavDVOySLF1aC5ps

Likes API: https://likes.api.freefireofficial.com/api/{region}/{uid}?key=testkey12

Regions can be: ind, sg, br, pk, bd, etc.

A Supabase table named usage_logs tracks who used the tool once per day using:

id (uuid)

uid (text)

region (text)

ip (text)

used_at (timestamp)

✅ Requirements

Fix the “fetch error” issue that happens on Vercel when trying to call the Likes API or Supabase.

Ensure all Supabase insert/select operations work properly on the live domain.

Make sure CORS is correctly configured for both Supabase and the Free Fire API so that fetch requests from the browser are allowed.

Verify that all frontend animations, transitions, and responsiveness remain exactly as in the Replit version.

Add one Google AdSense ad slot per page (just the divs; I’ll add my ad code).

Keep the structure flexible so I can add more tools later (like Free Fire Info Bot, Spam Bot, Visit Bot).

Ensure everything works perfectly across both desktop and mobile browsers.

Deploy it fully working on Vercel, not Replit hosting.

💡 Extra Notes

The project uses only frontend code — no backend server.

Supabase handles the data logic (one user/IP per day).

The API key testkey12 is for testing.

When Supabase or the API responds with “already used today” or “invalid UID,” the user’s limit shouldn’t be marked as used.

When status=1 and likes are successfully sent, show a nice congratulations UI (with name, likes before/after, level, etc.).

🚀 Deliverables

A working Vercel-hosted version of the site where:
✅ Likes API calls work perfectly
✅ Supabase read/write works from the frontend
✅ No CORS or fetch errors
✅ Design and animations stay beautiful and responsive

     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

🔹 Notes for AI

No backend, no hidden secrets → put all info directly in code.

Use clean, modern UI with blue neon animations.

Buttons should be professional (not fat, use glass/neon style).

Ads should not break layout → center them with margin.

Navigation bar fixed at top, animated hover.

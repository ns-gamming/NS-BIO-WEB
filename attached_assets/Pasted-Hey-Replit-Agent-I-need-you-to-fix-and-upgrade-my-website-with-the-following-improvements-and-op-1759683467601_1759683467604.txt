Hey Replit Agent 👋

I need you to fix and upgrade my website with the following improvements and optimizations. Please make sure everything is frontend-only (no backend setup) so it works flawlessly when hosted on Vercel or Netlify using my custom domain.

🧩 1. Privacy Policy Page Error

The Privacy Policy button/page is not working properly.

When I click on it, it gives an error or fails to load on both Vercel and Netlify.

Fix the issue using a frontend-only solution so the Privacy Policy opens correctly without any routing or deployment errors.

💰 2. Google AdSense Setup

Properly integrate Google AdSense so it can get approved by Google easily.

Add ads (at least one per page) in a way that fits naturally into the layout.

Follow Google’s AdSense best practices for compliance and approval.

Make sure ads don’t break the layout or slow down the page.

🎨 3. Design, UI & Animation Enhancements

Improve the overall UI/UX design to look professional, modern, and engaging.

Add smooth animations, scroll effects, and landing transitions.

Use responsive layouts that look perfect on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Apply beautiful themes, hover effects, gradients, and section transitions to attract visitors.

🤖 4. Gemini Chatbot Upgrade

Improve the existing AI chatbot (Gemini) to make it more human-like, smart, and responsive.

It should provide expert-level, natural answers, even in the free model.

You can directly include the Gemini API key:

Keep the chatbot frontend-only (no backend API calls that require server setup).

Enhance the chat design with a modern UI and subtle animations.

🧠 5. SEO & About Section Improvements

Write a more detailed and attractive “About Me” section that reflects my personality and achievements.

Include relevant keywords and SEO-friendly content to help my website rank better.

Make the text visually appealing with creative typography and layout.

⚙️ 6. Routing & Refresh Issue (Vercel)

When I navigate to a different page and refresh it, the page gives an error (404 or route not found).

Fix this using frontend routing solutions such as:

react-router-dom with BrowserRouter or HashRouter

or by adding a _redirects file for Netlify / a rewrite rule for Vercel.

Make sure the routing works perfectly across all pages after deployment.

🧰 7. General Improvements

Add more useful sections (contact form, testimonials, animations, etc.).

Optimize all pages for speed, performance, and SEO.

Test every feature to ensure the site works properly after deployment on Vercel with a custom domain.

💡 Finally:

Please explain clearly how I can fix the refresh/page load error on Vercel using free tools (like redirect rules or hash-based routing).
Ensure that the final website runs 100% from the frontend, with no backend dependencies or errors, and looks professional, interactive, and stable.

      "question": "What is the most important cybersecurity practice for beginners?",
      "answer": "The most critical practice is using strong, unique passwords for every account combined with two-factor authentication (2FA). A password manager like Bitwarden makes this easy by generating and storing complex passwords, while 2FA adds a second layer of protection that stops 99% of automated attacks. Start here before anything else."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I tell if an email is a phishing attempt?",
      "answer": "Look for these red flags: 1) Generic greetings like 'Dear Customer' instead of your name, 2) Urgent language creating panic ('Your account will be suspended!'), 3) Suspicious sender addresses (hover to see full email), 4) Grammar/spelling errors, 5) Unexpected attachments or links. Legitimate companies never ask for passwords via email. When in doubt, contact the company directly through their official website."

    {
      "question": "Do I really need antivirus software in 2025?",
      "answer": "Yes, absolutely. While Windows Defender has improved significantly and provides basic protection, dedicated antivirus software like Malwarebytes offers advanced threat detection, real-time protection, and ransomware defense. For Windows users, Windows Defender + Malwarebytes is a solid combination. Mac users should also use antivirus despite the myth that Macs don't get viruses—malware targeting macOS is increasing."

    {
      "question": "What should I do if I think my account has been hacked?",
      "answer": "Act immediately: 1) Disconnect the affected device from the internet, 2) Change passwords from a different, secure device, 3) Enable 2FA if not already active, 4) Run a full antivirus scan, 5) Notify the affected service (bank, email provider, social media), 6) Monitor accounts for unusual activity. If it's a financial account, contact your bank immediately and consider a credit freeze."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is public WiFi really that dangerous?",
      "answer": "Yes, public WiFi is extremely risky. Attackers can intercept unencrypted data, perform man-in-the-middle attacks, and create fake hotspots. Never access banking, email, or sensitive accounts on public WiFi without a VPN. Better yet, use your phone's mobile hotspot instead. If you must use public WiFi, always connect to a trusted VPN first—services like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, or ProtonVPN encrypt all your traffic."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do password managers work and are they safe?",
      "answer": "Password managers like Bitwarden, 1Password, or LastPass store all your passwords in an encrypted vault protected by one master password. They generate strong random passwords for each account, auto-fill credentials securely, and sync across devices. They're much safer than reusing passwords or writing them down. The encryption is military-grade, and even the company can't access your passwords. Just protect your master password carefully—it's the only one you need to remember."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between a VPN and antivirus?",
      "answer": "They serve different purposes. Antivirus protects your device from malware, viruses, and malicious software by scanning files and blocking threats. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet connection, hiding your activity from ISPs, hackers on public WiFi, and websites tracking you. You need BOTH for complete protection—antivirus for device security and VPN for network privacy."

    {
      "question": "How can gamers specifically protect their accounts?",
      "answer": "Gamers should: 1) Enable 2FA on Steam, Epic, Garena, Xbox, PlayStation using authenticator apps (not SMS), 2) Use unique passwords for gaming accounts—never reuse your email password, 3) Avoid 'free items' scams (free V-Bucks, diamonds are always scams), 4) Only download games from official platforms, 5) Secure Discord by only joining verified servers and never clicking unknown links, 6) Enable Steam Guard and trade holds to protect inventory items."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the best free cybersecurity tools?",
      "answer": "Essential free tools include: 1) Bitwarden (password manager), 2) uBlock Origin (ad and tracker blocker), 3) Windows Defender (basic antivirus for Windows), 4) Malwarebytes free version (malware scanner), 5) HTTPS Everywhere (force encrypted connections), 6) Privacy Badger (tracker blocking), 7) ProtonVPN free tier (limited VPN), 8) DuckDuckGo (private search engine). These cover password management, browsing security, malware protection, and privacy."

    {
      "question": "How do I check if my data has been part of a breach?",
      "answer": "Visit haveibeenpwned.com and enter your email address. This free service, created by security expert Troy Hunt, checks your email against databases of known breaches. If your email appears, change passwords immediately on affected sites, enable 2FA, and monitor for suspicious activity. Also check for your passwords using the 'Passwords' section—but never enter actual passwords, only check hashes or partial matches."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's two-factor authentication and why do I need it?",
      "answer": "Two-factor authentication (2FA) requires two different proofs of identity to log in: something you know (password) and something you have (phone with authenticator app or security key). Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account without the second factor. Use authenticator apps like Google Authenticator or Authy—they're much more secure than SMS codes which can be intercepted through SIM swapping attacks."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are cryptocurrency wallets safe from hackers?",
      "answer": "Cryptocurrency security depends entirely on how you store it. Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor) are safest for significant holdings—they store private keys offline and are nearly impossible to hack remotely. Software wallets and exchange accounts are vulnerable if your device is compromised. Never share your seed phrase (recovery words) with anyone—it gives complete access to your funds. Enable 2FA on exchanges and use withdrawal address whitelisting for additional protection."

    {
      "question": "How can students protect themselves online?",
      "answer": "Students should: 1) Use strong, unique passwords for school accounts with 2FA if available, 2) Don't share login credentials with classmates, 3) Use privacy settings on Zoom/Teams meetings (waiting rooms, passwords), 4) Manage Google Docs permissions carefully (specific people only, not 'anyone with link'), 5) Be aware that universities check social media during admissions—delete inappropriate content, 6) Report cyberbullying with screenshots, 7) Use reputable sources for research and fact-check information."
    },
    {
      "question": "What should I backup and how often?",
      "answer": "Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: 3 copies of data (original + 2 backups), 2 different media types (external drive + cloud), 1 off-site backup. Backup: important documents, photos/videos, game saves, school/work projects, and password manager database. For critical files, backup weekly. For photos and documents, monthly is sufficient. Automate backups using Windows File History, macOS Time Machine, or cloud services like Backblaze ($7/month unlimited). Test restoration quarterly to ensure backups actually work."

    {
      "question": "Is it worth pursuing a cybersecurity career?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! Cybersecurity faces a 3.5 million person talent shortage globally in 2025, making it one of the fastest-growing, highest-paying tech fields. Entry-level security analysts earn $50K-$80K, mid-level penetration testers $80K-$120K, and senior CISOs $120K-$200K+. You can start with self-learning (TryHackMe, HackTheBox are free), earn certifications (CompTIA Security+ is entry-level standard), or pursue formal education. The field offers job security, intellectual challenges, and the satisfaction of protecting people and organizations."

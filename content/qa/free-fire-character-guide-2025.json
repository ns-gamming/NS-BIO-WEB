    "q": "When should I use character abilities?",
    "a": "Use Alok's ability when pushing or rotating, activate K's ability before gunfights for EP advantage, deploy Skyler's gloo walls strategically for cover. Track cooldowns between fights and save ultimates for final circles.",

    "q": "Best characters for Clash Squad?",
    "a": "Focus on combat abilities: K (EP management and Jiu-Jitsu mode), Alok (healing and speed), and Skyler (gloo wall control). Looting isn't a factor so pure combat abilities matter most.",
